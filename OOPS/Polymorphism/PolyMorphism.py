# PolyMorphism:- 
#             Poly means  many and morphism means forms
#             Polymorphism enebles a single function  or operator to work in different ways depending on the Context.


#             Polymorphism means "many forms". In Python, polymorphism allows the same interface (like a method or operator) to behave differently depending on the object or data type it is working with.

# âœ… Types of Polymorphism in Python

#     Duck Typing  - 	Focus on method presence, not type 

#     Operator Overloading - 	Same operator, different behavior

#     Function Overloading (Simulated) - 	Simulated using default args or *args
    
#     Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism) - Child class redefines parent method





# super() Method  se overload
# class classA:
#     def myfunction(self):
#         print("This is class A")
# class classB:
#     def myfunction(self):
#         print("This is class B")
# class classC:
#     def myfunction(self):
#         print("This is class C")
# ob=classC()
# ob.myfunction()
